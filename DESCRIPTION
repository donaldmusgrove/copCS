Description: The concentration matrix Q is computed using localized iterative
    proportional scaling (IPS). The inputs are a first-order correlation rho and an
    adjacency matrix A. IPS iteratively computes a valid correlation matrix based on
    Gaussian graphical models with the conditional restrictions implied by A.
